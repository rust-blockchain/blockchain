//! Common trait definitions related to block context.
//!
//! The consensus layer for this crate works on different levels.
//!
//! On execute level, one uses `ExecuteContext`, and the type parameters defined
//! allows it to be used by an executor -- given a block, and an externalities,
//! it executes the state. This is suitable for plain state transition.
//!
//! On importer level, one uses `ImportContext`. This allows the block to be
//! written into a backend together with auxiliaries. This is suitable for
//! implementing common consensus algorithms.
//!
//! On builder level, one uses `BuildContext`. This allows to be used with
//! `BuilderExecutor` which is able to create new blocks. Used together with
//! `ImportContext`, one can build a proposer.
